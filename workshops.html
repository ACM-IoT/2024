        <h2>Call for Workshop Proposals</h2>
        <p class="text-block">
          Influenced by the advancement of connected, low-cost sensing and actuation, alongside a variety of
          scientifically and economically significant applications they enable, the Internet of Things has emerged as a
          key area of research.
          This field extends its influence across various domains, both within the core of information technology and
          its adjacent areas.
          Particular challenges include understanding IoT application/user demands, heterogeneous architectures and
          interoperability, emerging IoT communication technologies and their coexistence, cross-layer hard and soft
          quality of service guarantees, and integrating and mediating Things within intelligent systems.
          The International Conference on the Internet of Things is the premier gathering for visionary and
          groundbreaking research in IoT and closely-related fields.
          It connects world-class researchers with leading industry experts to steer innovation in multiple IoT
          verticals (e.g., smart industry, smart city/urban, smart health, smart environment).
          Since its start in 2008, the conference has been backed by strong support from leading academic institutions
          as well as industry.
          We are pleased to announce its 14th edition and associated workshops, will take place from <b>November 19-22
            in Oulu, Finland</b>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          The objective of the <b>IoT 2024 workshop program</b> is to provide additional forums for discussing novel
          ideas related to IoT subareas and to stimulate and facilitate active exchange, interaction, and comparison of
          approaches, methods, and ideas related to IoT.
          The goal is to have a balanced workshop program comprising workshops of different types and formats combining
          emerging and established topics.
          Workshops should provide an informal and vibrant forum for researchers and industry practitioners to share
          their research results and practical experiences.
          This year, we encourage submissions related, but not limited to, IoT-enabled alternate realities as well as
          assured autonomy and resilient IoT.
        </p>
        <h3 id="proposals">Workshop Proposals and Information</h3>
        <p class="text-block">
          IoT 2024 invites <b>full-day and half-day workshop proposals</b> with a clearly defined scope that falls in
          the general topics of the conference.
          We also encourage submission of workshop proposals that follow alternative formats such as hackathons,
          plugfests, demo jams, and breakout sessions as long as they can be conducted in hybrid settings.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          The organizers of accepted workshops will be responsible for workshops' reviewing processes and publicity with
          support from IoT 2024 general chairs, which will announce all accepted workshops as collocated events on the
          conference website and via its publicity channels.
          IoT 2024 will publish accepted workshop papers in companion proceedings to the conference's main proceedings.
        </p>
        <p class="text-block">
          Workshop participants will be required to register for the full conference.
          At the discretion of the chairs, workshops may be canceled if organizers have not registered in a timely
          manner or if a workshop has received too few submissions.
          In the latter case we encourage the organizers to consider merging their workshop with another fitting
          workshop under a broader theme.
          Workshop organizers will receive one complimentary full conference registration.
        </p>
